# Stache

Mustache templates in Elixir!

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed as:

  1. Add stache to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

        def deps do
          [{:stache, "~> 0.0.1"}]
        end

  2. Ensure stache is started before your application:

        def application do
          [applications: [:stache]]
        end
